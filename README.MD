Functional Google Code Jam
===========================

A toy project cataloguing my novice-level solutions for Google Code Jam. This is
meant mostly as a way to track my own understanding of FP. _"Functional"_ here
means that I've mostly tried to implement the whole project in as purely
functional of a programming style as I can manage. The solutions may not be the
most performant, elegant, or even just idiomatic way to use the functional subset
of Scala. However, I hope to learn from anyone interested in contributing to this
project.

Running
=======
Run with sbt as follows:

`sbt > run <input_path> <output_path>`
